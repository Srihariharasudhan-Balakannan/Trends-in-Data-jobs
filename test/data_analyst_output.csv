A lot has been done to make financial products accessible to people. However, it still remains an urban concept. We will make quality financial advice accessible and approachable across Bharat.
ZFunds was born when we realized that consumers in all small towns across India have invested their money in LIC policies. For users looking to grow their money, it's probably one of the worst options over a long period of time. We realized that it's not a problem that consumers don't want better financial products, it's that they don't have supply to it. And that is what ZFunds is here to do.
We are now in the growth phase of your journey and are looking for driven developers to drive that ruthlessly alongside us.
