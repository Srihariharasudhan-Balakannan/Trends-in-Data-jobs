Position Summary
We look for talented Data Scientists who can roll up their sleeves and have direct impact on our company metrics. The performance of our models and experiments are seen astonishingly quickly the learning loop is not measured in weeks or days, but hours and minutes. We live in what might be the fastest model-learning playgrounds in the world. We have built an infrastructure that enables model deployment at both scale and speed. As data scientists, we sit alongside engineering colleagues who enable our models to deploy. Combine this with our growing variable set of hundreds of potential features (and growing!), and this is a highly fertile environment for building, experimenting, refining and achieving real impact from your models. If models fire, the bottom-line impact to our teams is immediate you see the value of your work incredibly fast.
Who Are You
Our scientists are expected to possess deep expertise and experience in Ad Tech, AI/ML, and Data Science, particularly at scale. Familiarity with big data processing and cloud computing will be critical to succeed in this environment.

They will also need to work with other engineers to take these solutions to live production and drive real business value.
Most importantly, we look for a passion to investigate and learn about the world from data, to ask interesting and provocative questions, and be driven to put real models into production that drive real business value.
We are open to diverse academic backgrounds, providing an intent to think and problem-solve like a data scientist. Our team includes engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists, economists and social scientists a rock-star data scientist can come from any academic field.
Required
Master's in a quantitative field such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Operations Research or Economics, Analytics, Data Science. Or Bachelor's from a reputed College with additional experience.
7-10 years of work experience in a quantitative field, with model building and validation experience.

Possess a high degree of curiosity and ability to rapidly learn new areas.
What will you do
You will be responsible for leading one or more data science efforts for inMobi DSP, a gold mine that is being explored for riches. This involves project ideation and conceptualization, solution design, measurement and solution iteration, coaching, deployment and post deployment management.
This will also include designing, development, testing of product experiments.
You are expected to be a hands-on part of the role where you will also actively analyse data, design and develop models, and solve problems with the rest of the team.
Additionally, stakeholder management is needed. It will involve being the interface with internal stakeholders such as our Product, Engineering, Data, Infrastructure, and Business teams.
Our team strives for thought leadership in the sector. We encourage and support all team members to write blogs, commentary and case studies published on the InMobi blog. We also support team members across our MLAI team to speak at industry conferences and represent InMobi's work.
