To learn more, please visit www. outreach. io .\n\nThe Role\n\nBridging Intelligence and Action\nThe Cyber Intel Fusion Analyst is a pivotal role within our security program.\n\nThis position serves as a critical bridge, linking strategic threat intelligence with tactical security operations.\nThe analyst will be instrumental in evolving our security practices beyond traditional, siloed functions while ensuring that intelligence capabilities are not merely insightful but are directly integrated and operationalized within our security framework.\nThis proactive operationalization of intelligence is key to anticipating emerging threats and developing innovative countermeasures to counter sophisticated cyber threats before they can impact our services or compromise sensitive information.\nThe ability to quickly fuse intelligence into operational defense mechanisms provides a distinct security advantage, crucial for maintaining service reliability and customer trust.\nYour Daily Adventures Will Include\nCore Responsibilities: Shaping Our Defenses\nThe responsibilities of the Cyber Intel Fusion Analyst are multifaceted, demanding a blend of analytical acumen, technical expertise, and collaborative skill.\nIntelligence Cycle Management Requirements Definition: The analyst will manage the intelligence analysis cycle as it pertains to team operations. This includes working closely with team operators and other stakeholders to identify and refine intelligence requirements that drive threat emulation assessments and inform defensive strategies. A key function involves identifying intelligence requirements for diverse areas such as security operations, cloud security, enterprise security, and application security, including those related to artificial intelligence. This broad scope necessitates an understanding of the unique intelligence needs of various teams, positioning the analyst as a strategic partner who can tailor and deliver relevant intelligence to enhance the effectiveness of multiple security functions.\nTactical Intelligence Analysis Adversary Understanding: A core function is providing tactical cyber intelligence analysis, meticulously identifying specific adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This analysis will be consistently tied back to established frameworks like the MITRE ATTCK Framework, leveraging intelligence provided by relevant organizations. The role involves recognizing and researching attacks and attack patterns based onpublished open-source intelligence (OSINT) and other intelligence sources. The analyst will be adept at handling and organizing disparate data concerning detections, attacks, and attackers to accurately identify adversary groups and their modus operandi, thereby driving assessments pertinent to the company. This process transforms general threat data into a refined understanding of adversaries specifically targeting our environment, such as those focusing on SaaS platforms if applicable.\nDeveloping Actionable Intelligence Driving Threat Emulation: The analyst is tasked with developing, producing, and managing Adversary Response Playbooks. These playbooks are crucial for supporting and driving threat emulation assessments, ensuring our defenses are tested against realistic adversary behaviors. 1 This involves translating analyzed intelligence on adversary TTPs and campaign indicators into actionable detection strategies, such as developing custom SIEM correlation rules or contributing to Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) playbooks. This operationalization of intelligence is fundamental, turning analytical findings into tangible, proactive defensive measures that strengthen our security posture.\nCollaboration, Liaison Stakeholder Management: Effective relationship management is paramount. The analyst will manage relationships with organizations, both internal and external, that provide requested intelligence to the team or receive information from it. A significant part of the role includes representing the team in cyber threat intelligence-related meetings and matters, acting as a crucial liaison.
